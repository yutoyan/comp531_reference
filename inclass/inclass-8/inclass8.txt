For homework 1:

I spent roughly one hour on it and I guess the validation part took
most time of it.

For homework 2:

I spent around 4 hours on it. I find that using javascript to cyclye 
through different images and assigning one button for each image to 
stop/start the cycling a little bit difficult. What's more, I spend 
a lot of time tring to make the website looks good.
