First of all, I want to say this is really a great course and I have learned a lot
from taking this class and doing projects. Thank you for offering this awesome course!

I really loved learning how to integrate the backend and frontend together. It gives
me the whole picture of my project and I start to see how all parts interact with each
other and become a complete, fully functional application.

And I also love the way we build our applications. We build small features one by one
in in-class exercises, put several into our homeworks, and finally put all homeworks
together to become a complete one. This course stays challenging throughout the whole
semester but won't crush most students at the end.

One thing I would suggest is that probably posting the presentation a day or a half
before class would be great. Since the pace of the class is really fast, it would be
helpful if we could read through the presentation first and get us familiar with the topic.
Sometimes I just stuck to one sentence or one line of code of the slides and could not
follow the pace of the rest of the lecture afterwards.

I would also suggest that maybe we could have recordings of the lectures, especially for
the live demo part. Again, I am not familiar with some topics so I spent a lot of time
watching youtube videos if I did not catch it in class. But I believe the most helpful
resources is our class. So it would be great if we could watch it again and take some
time to understand it thoroughly.

Scott and Terry are very helpful through this whole semester. This is also one key feature
of this class. I could always get prompt feedback and explanations in person or from piazza,
which really helps me survive this class and learns a lot from it. Thank you!
